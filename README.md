# SFHS Arduino Club

## What is it?
[SFHS Arduino Club](https://www.sfhs-arduino-club.com) is a student club featuring hands-on learning through [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/) and other similar electrical platforms. Furthermore, we use code to program the circuits to perform something as simple as a blinking LED to something as advanced as programming motor movements.

## About the code
For a basic introduction of Arduino programming, visit [*Built-in Examples*](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples).

Note that programming the Arduino is not limited to C++! We can use Java to send or receive information from the Arduino and graph the output values.

On this GitHub, there are two subsets: examples (e##_Name) and [projects](https://www.sfhs-arduino-club.com/projects) (p##_Name).

Any club member can offer example code to this repository. If you have an example that you would like added, please open a [pull request](https://github.com/sfhs-arduino-club/sfhs-arduino-club/pulls), and a board member will review it. See [#1](https://github.com/sfhs-arduino-club/sfhs-arduino-club/pull/1) for an example and [*About pull requests*](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for more information about pull requests.
